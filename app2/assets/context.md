Project Overview: Trade Strategy Dashboard Web Application

This project will create a comprehensive trading dashboard that displays portfolio statistics and trade strategy testing results. The application is built using modern web technologies with a focus on clean design, seamless interactivity, and robust integration with financial data sources and analysis tools.

1. Frontend

Framework & Library:
	•	React with Next.js 15
	•	UI Framework: Shadcn UI (as defined in your ui_theme.md)
	•	The theme specifies key CSS variables for backgrounds, text, cards, and even chart colors (e.g., --chart-1 to --chart-5) that will be used throughout the application. This ensures consistency in styling, whether in dark mode or light mode.
	•	Use the provided Radix UI icons for interactive elements like toggles, buttons, and navigation (e.g., <FaceIcon />, <SunIcon />, `  ￼).

Pages & Components:
	•	Welcome Screen:
	•	A clean entry point that greets users.
	•	Email-based signup/login with Firebase authentication.
	•	Use clear, concise messaging with a focus on usability.
	•	Main Dashboard:
	•	Portfolio Summary: Displays key statistics (e.g., current balance, open positions, performance metrics) in card components styled with Shadcn UI.
	•	Interactive Graph Section:
	•	A primary area to view raw historical data.
	•	Overlays strategy outputs, configurable indicators, and real-time data streams.
	•	Mimic the look of Backtrader graphs using custom chart components that apply the theme’s chart color variables (e.g., --chart-1 through --chart-5).
	•	Secondary Graph Page:
	•	A dedicated page replicating the Backtrader graph aesthetics.
	•	Allows users to dive deeper into historical trends, with interactivity for zooming, panning, and filtering data.
	•	Dark/Light Mode Toggle:
	•	Dark mode is set as the default.
	•	Toggle seamlessly changes the CSS variable values based on the definitions in ui_theme.md, ensuring that every UI element (background, text, cards, borders, etc.) adjusts accordingly.

Communication Protocols:
	•	Use secure HTTPS communication between the frontend and backend.
	•	Establish RESTful endpoints or Firebase Cloud Functions with proper authentication (e.g., JWT tokens) to ensure data integrity and secure data transfer.

2. Backend & Data Integration

Backend/Database:
	•	Firebase:
	•	Authentication: Handle email-based signup and login.
	•	Database: Store user portfolio data, strategy test results, and configuration settings (e.g., Firestore or Realtime Database).
	•	Functions: Use Firebase Cloud Functions for secure and authenticated API endpoints to communicate with external services.

External APIs and Tools:
	•	Alpaca API (Paper Trading & Stock Data Stream):
	•	Integrate for real-time paper trading data and continuous stock data feeds.
	•	Ensure data integrity with proper authentication and rate-limiting measures.
	•	Backtrader Package:
	•	Use Backtrader on the server side to simulate and test trade strategies.
	•	Process historical data from Alpaca and generate signals or performance metrics.
	•	Anthropic API (AI Processing):
	•	Integrate for advanced analysis, such as generating trade insights, risk assessments, or predictive commentary on strategy performance.
	•	The output can be displayed as additional insights on the dashboard.

Data Pipeline:
	•	Stock Data Ingestion:
	•	Stream data from Alpaca API into a real-time processing layer.
	•	Feed this data into Backtrader for running simulations and backtesting.
	•	Results & Analytics:
	•	Store processed results in Firebase.
	•	Update dashboard components dynamically to reflect the latest analytics.
	•	Logging & Error Handling:
	•	Implement robust logging to capture data pipeline events, API call failures, and strategy testing results.
	•	Monitor the pipeline to remove unused or redundant code paths, ensuring optimal performance.

3. UI Theme & Styling

Utilizing Shadcn UI & Custom Theme Variables:
	•	The theme file (ui_theme.md) defines a comprehensive set of CSS variables:
	•	Base Colors: Variables such as --background, --foreground, --card, and --popover provide a clean and modern look in both light and dark modes.
	•	Primary & Secondary Colors: Ensure that buttons, links, and highlights follow the primary (--primary) and secondary (--secondary) color schemes.
	•	Chart Colors: The chart-specific variables (--chart-1 through --chart-5) allow you to maintain consistency when plotting historical data and strategy results.
	•	Dark Mode Overrides: When dark mode is active, alternate variable values (e.g., darker backgrounds, lighter foregrounds) are used automatically, ensuring a seamless visual transition.
	•	Best Practices:
	•	Always refer to the variables defined in the theme when styling components to ensure consistency.
	•	Utilize Shadcn UI components for rapid development while overriding or extending styles as needed.

4. Integration & Communication

Frontend-Backend Communication:
	•	Use Firebase’s secure APIs to manage user data and authentication.
	•	For external API calls (Alpaca, Anthropic, Backtrader integrations), implement a middleware layer on Firebase Cloud Functions or a dedicated server to handle API keys and data processing.
	•	Ensure that all communication follows proper protocol standards, such as HTTPS and token-based authentication, to maintain security and reliability.

Component Communication:
	•	Utilize React context or state management libraries to propagate settings like dark mode toggles and user session data across components.
	•	Design your interactive graph components to be modular, allowing you to swap out or reconfigure charting libraries if needed.

Conclusion

This structured specification provides a clear blueprint for building a trade strategy dashboard web application that:
	•	Offers a clean, modern user experience using Next.js, React, and Shadcn UI.
	•	Integrates seamlessly with financial data sources and strategy backtesting tools.
	•	Leverages Firebase for secure user management and data storage.
	•	Implements robust, scalable communication protocols between frontend and backend.
	•	Uses the comprehensive theming provided in your ui_theme.md file to ensure a consistent and visually appealing UI across all components.
